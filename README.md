# About this repo
This is my COMP6841 something awesome project!

# Marking criteria
* High distinction — has keylogging functions
* Distinction — doesn't look suspicious, looks like a normal extension
* Credit — Send cookies via the internet
* Pass — Steals cookies


# TODO
* [x] Make a simple extension
* [x] Steal cookie via `chrome.cookies`, console.log that thing
* [x] Use requestbin/etc to send it back
* [ ] Maybe even try sniff requests ('network' page in chrome dev tool), can get tokens (refer: `chrome.webRequest`)?
* [ ] Build a git commit message generator extension. Just query `fetch("http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt")`
* [ ] Keylogging??? We'll see
